        name: "Mashing",
        bio: "The 'mash' is a porridge-like mixture made from water and crushed grains. Specially bred strains of malted barley make malt from Montreal, Canada. We do support the Canadian craft brewers association through all supply chains. Our malting process degrades the protein matrix binding the starch granules within a temperature range of 35°C to 45°C (95°F to 113°F). Glucanases have an ideal temperature of 45°C-55°C (113°F-131°F) and break down the hemicelluloses gums, whereas amylases break down the starch granules and perform best at 61°C–67°C (141.8°F-152.6°F).",

    malting:{
        name: "Malting",
        bio: "Our craft beer is based on specialty malt, the following handcraft process. When the duration, temperature, or humidity of the three steps of the malting process—steeping, germination, and drying—are changed to create individual flavors and colors, or distinctive functions, specialty malts are created. Dr. Nut chooses The best cereal grain for brewing and, ultimately, malting is barley. It has a husk to shield the germ, a high starch-to-protein ratio for high yields, a full enzyme system, a self-adjusting pH, a light hue, and an unflavored husk, making it self-contained.

    fermentation:{
        name: "Fermentation",
        bio: "The primary stage of fermentation occurs when the yeast is placed into cooled, aerated wort. Sterols, a crucial substance for culture proliferation, are produced by the yeast fast using the oxygen that is available. When oxygen is no longer present, the yeast transition to anaerobic fermentation, where most of the wort sugars are converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO2). Yeast growth happens during the first fermentation. The extent and velocity of yeast growth are directly related to the synthesis of fragrance and flavor components. Our beer follows the lagers procedure with 46-58 °F (8-14 °C) temperature.",

    boiling:{
        name: "Boiling",
        bio: "During the boil, some of the water evaporates, thereby concentrating the wort. The kettle's size and shape, the surface area exposed to the air, the heat source's intensity, and to a lesser extent other factors like the ambient temperature, humidity, air pressure, and any air movement around the kettle, affect how much liquid evaporates. Our machines boiled an average of 50 gallons per hour.",

    aging:{
        name: "Aging",
        bio: "Similar to wine maturing, our craft beer follows the ideal conditions for storing bottled beer. Most beers mature best at 'cellar temperatures' of roughly 11°C to 13°C (about 52°F to 55°F). Colder temperatures will impede the aging process; considerably warmer temperatures will hasten age, although the outcomes will tend to be less pleasant. These bottles are stored upright in the dark. Dr. Nut is stored for six to nine months in the pantry and six more months in the refrigerator.",
